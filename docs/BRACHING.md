# Branching Schemes

## Main Branches

The following are the main branches in the repository. These branches are protected and cannot be pushed to directly.

- `main`: For production use. Only accepts PRs from `develop` (and `hotfix/` in emergencies).
- `develop`: The default branch, which accepts PRs from the feature branches listed below.

## Feature Branches

The following are the types of branches that can be created from the `develop` branch.

**Note:** \*_The `hotfix/` branch is an exception . It should be branched from and merged back into the `main` branch._

- `feat/`: Branches for developing new features or enhancements.
- `fix/`: Branches for fixing bugs or issues.
- `hotfix/`: Branches for fixing _urgent_ issues in production.
- `refactor/`: Branches for refactoring code.
- `test/`: Branches for testing new features or changes.
- `docs/`: Branches for updating documentation.
- `chore/`: Branches for changes that do not fit into any of the above categories.
